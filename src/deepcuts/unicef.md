### Case Study: UNICEF Suriname – "Umi Says" Podcast Campaign

### Project Overview

UNICEF tasked us with translating key data points from the *Children’s Snapshot Suriname 2023* document, which outlines the wellbeing of children in Suriname. The report revealed the combined effects of the pandemic, socio-economic crises, and social unrest, all of which are having a significant impact on children’s overall wellbeing, particularly their mental health.

While adults have traditionally been the ones to voice children’s thoughts and concerns, we wanted to break this pattern by giving children a platform to share their own perspectives on their experiences and the current state of affairs in Suriname. Our goal was to create a space for children to express their thoughts and feelings directly, with a focus on amplifying their voices in a way that would touch both the public and policymakers.

### Concept Development

We wanted to step away from the traditional communication format often used by organizations—dense reports with high barriers to entry—and instead create a more accessible, engaging, and personal medium. The idea was born to use a live podcast, set in a place of symbolic importance, and let the children "talk around the watercooler," but this time quite literally.

In collaboration with UNICEF, we created a pop-up space in the heart of the capital, Paramaribo, at DNA, the government building housing the Parliament. Within the building was an old well, which became the perfect setting for our podcast, serving as a metaphorical "watercooler" where real conversations happen. The location also symbolized Suriname’s political heart, aligning the children’s voices with where decisions about their futures are being made.

### “Umi Says” – The Podcast

The podcast was titled **"Umi Says,"** inspired by the Mos Def song of the same name. The choice of title worked on two levels:

1. **Direct Expression**: The opening lyrics of the song say, "I don’t want to write this down, I want to tell you how I feel right now." This sentiment echoed our approach: encouraging children to speak their minds freely and directly in the form of a podcast, rather than rely on written reports and complex documents.
2. **Homophone to "UNICEF"**: Phonetically, "Umi Says" sounds like "Unicef," further tying the campaign to the organization’s mission and creating an association between UNICEF’s work and the authentic voices of Suriname's children.

### The Podcast Setup

We designed the podcast to be both an event and a form of activism. It was recorded from the watercooler in the Parliament building, allowing children from different age groups and backgrounds to share their thoughts about their current realities in Suriname.

By using this format, the podcast captured raw, unfiltered stories and allowed listeners to hear firsthand how the crises were shaping the lives of Surinamese children. The space was intimate yet public, symbolizing that the children’s voices needed to be heard at the highest levels of decision-making.

### Out-of-Home Campaign: A Visual Invitation

To draw attention to the podcast and encourage public participation, we launched an **Out-of-Home (OOH)** campaign inspired by Pelle Cass' iconic cover for *The New Yorker*. The OOH activation featured a dynamic collage of movement at a busy intersection in Paramaribo, visually capturing the energy and chaos of the city’s current state. We invited passers-by to walk a pre-defined route through the intersection and sign a quit claim, symbolically contributing their presence to the campaign. This production doubled as an open invitation to the podcast recording, encouraging community engagement and participation.

### Amplification and Impact

The campaign was strategically seeded among local activist groups, shoot participants, and media outlets, ensuring that the message reached a broad audience. In addition to paid media placements, the organic amplification from grassroots organizations helped to generate significant buzz.

By positioning the children’s voices at the center of this campaign, we highlighted their agency in shaping conversations about their own futures. The combination of a live podcast, a playful yet politically resonant setting, and an OOH campaign that encouraged real-time interaction helped create a powerful activation that was both symbolic and impactful.

### Results

* **Engagement**: The podcast episodes garnered substantial attention, both from the local public and international stakeholders. The choice of a live format allowed for spontaneous, authentic discussions that connected deeply with listeners.
* **Visibility**: The OOH campaign, particularly the use of a busy intersection as a canvas, captured the attention of passers-by and created a visually compelling narrative about children’s place in society.
* **Media Coverage**: Local media outlets, along with activist groups, played a key role in spreading the word, amplifying the children’s voices to a wider audience. UNICEF’s involvement added credibility and further strengthened the reach of the campaign.

Through the *"Umi Says"* project, we were able to provide a platform for Surinamese children to express themselves, bridging the gap between policy discussions and the everyday realities they face. This campaign succeeded in both raising awareness of the challenges children in Suriname are grappling with and shifting the narrative by allowing children to lead the conversation themselves.
